# Employee Management System Project
## React + Vite

I have Created an Employee Management System Project with React.js Tailwind CSS and Local Storage

in this project we have two dashboards and one login page.
1) Admin Dashboard
2) Employee Dashboard

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
